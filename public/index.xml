In the UX world, the term is used to describe that rare person who can do it all — design, research, write, and code — and do it at a very high level. It&amp;rsquo;s become so common that companies looking for talent are putting out job ads for so-called &amp;ldquo;unicorns.</description></item><item><title>Magnitude</title><link>http://drewux.com/posts/2016-10-16-magnitude/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Oct 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://drewux.com/posts/2016-10-16-magnitude/</guid><description>Magnitude A Simple Tool to Help Prioritize Usability Issues 6 minute read When prioritizing usability problems, use a Magnitude Matrix to figure out the most important issues to address. Magnitude combines the frequency that an issue was observed with the relative impact that it had on the participant&amp;rsquo;s task completion.
After spending some time revisiting best practices in the realm of usability testing and reviewing the advice of some its more esteemed practitioners, I realized that there is a lot of talk about how to go about setting up such a test, and finding usability problems.</description></item><item><title>Playback</title><link>http://drewux.com/posts/2016-10-2-playback/</link><pubDate>Sun, 02 Oct 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://drewux.com/posts/2016-10-2-playback/</guid><description>Playback Often the best way to fix your faults is to look directly at them 4 minute read Regularly reviewing your performance and providing self-critique can help you improve your skills as a usability test moderator.
The camera and microphone are powerful implements in a usability tester&amp;rsquo;s toolkit. With them, you can capture the user&amp;rsquo;s actions and facial expressions and gain all kinds of insight into their behaviors, thoughts and expectations when using a product.</description></item><item><title>Reporting Qualitative Data</title><link>http://drewux.com/posts/2016-09-24-reporting-qualitative-data/</link><pubDate>Sat, 24 Sep 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://drewux.com/posts/2016-09-24-reporting-qualitative-data/</guid><description>Reporting Qualitative Data Gaining Control of the Fuzzy Non-Numeric 3 minute read When dealing with moderate to large sets of qualitative data, affinity analysis can help identify and prioritize common issues that users experience.
We&amp;rsquo;ve spent a lot of time discussing quantitative data this week: Collecting, measuring, and analyzing it. This got me thinking about its more nebulous twin — qualitative data — and how it&amp;rsquo;s a whole different beast.</description></item><item><title>Eye-Tracking on the Cheap</title><link>http://drewux.com/posts/2016-09-17-eye-tracking-on-the-cheap/</link><pubDate>Sat, 17 Sep 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://drewux.com/posts/2016-09-17-eye-tracking-on-the-cheap/</guid><description>Eye-Tracking on the Cheap A Dead-Simple Way to Follow Your Test Participants 2 minute read In the absence of eye-tracking equipment, ask test participants to use their mouse cursor to indicate where they’re looking on the screen.
One of the hallmarks of usability testing protocols is [the “Think Aloud” method][1]: Asking participants to verbalize their thoughts as they work through the tasks and activities of the test. This method allows the test team to get inside the head of the participant a bit and often illuminates behaviors or attitudes that wouldn’t be apparent by observation alone.</description></item><item><title>Formative vs. Summative Usability Studies</title><link>http://drewux.com/posts/2016-09-10-formative-summative-usability/</link><pubDate>Sat, 10 Sep 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://drewux.com/posts/2016-09-10-formative-summative-usability/</guid><description>Staying Ahead of the Wave Formative vs. Summative Usability Studies 2 ½ minute read When looking at usability studies, you can generally lump them into two groups: Formative studies and summative studies. We&amp;rsquo;ve been talking about them this week and I thought I&amp;rsquo;d share a little bit about our approach.
Formative Studies Formative studies, as the name implies, tend to happen at the beginning of the design process and are used to help guide the product in the right direction.</description></item><item><title>Remote UX Observation</title><link>http://drewux.com/posts/2016-09-01-getting-out-of-the-room/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Sep 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://drewux.com/posts/2016-09-01-getting-out-of-the-room/</guid><description>Remote UX Observation Getting Out of the Room to Enhance Team Participation In UX 4 ½ minute read One of the major tenets we adhere to as a team is transparency: All members of the team should have access to information about the project we’re working on. Designers, Developers, QA Analysts, Stakeholders: They all should have a complete picture of what’s going on and access to any details of the project that might help them gain product perspective and user insights.</description></item><item><title>IxD Retrospective</title><link>http://drewux.com/posts/2016-07-01-ixd-retrospective/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Jul 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://drewux.com/posts/2016-07-01-ixd-retrospective/</guid><description>Retrospective Looking back on the Kent State Interaction Design class 4 minute read So another course in the Kent State University User Experience Design Masters program comes to an end and, as one of its requirements has been these weekly updates, I thought it would be a good idea to use the final one to look back on the class.
I’ve spent the last seven weeks diving into Interaction Design; looking into the design process for digital products from the user interface perspective.</description></item><item><title>Organized</title><link>http://drewux.com/posts/2016-06-26-organized/</link><pubDate>Sun, 26 Jun 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://drewux.com/posts/2016-06-26-organized/</guid><description>Organized The extra time taken to arrange your work is a true sign of professionalism 2½ minute read Look. What your workspace looks like when you go home for the day is your business. It’s your space and you need to be comfortable and able to get stuff done. Maybe it’s a minimalist nirvana; clean and cool and white. Maybe it’s a nest of papers, books, half-empty soda cans… whatever works for you.</description></item><item><title>Measure Twice, Cut Once</title><link>http://drewux.com/posts/2016-06-19-mobile-layouts/</link><pubDate>Sun, 19 Jun 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://drewux.com/posts/2016-06-19-mobile-layouts/</guid><description>Measure Twice, Cut Once Creating a reusable layout system for mobile 4 ½ minute read So, while slugging it out in the trenches this week, I sort of fell into an existential crisis with regards to the stuff I was putting on the screen for a mobile prototype. Panels, images, buttons, text fields&amp;hellip; the sizing and positioning of these things all suddenly seemed so arbitrary. How can you defend a design decision if you can&amp;rsquo;t explain why the thing on the screen looks like it does?</description></item><item><title>Critique</title><link>http://drewux.com/posts/2016-06-12-critique/</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 Jun 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://drewux.com/posts/2016-06-12-critique/</guid><description>Critique When having your back means shooting you down 5 minute read I’ve got a good team.
I know this not because my team is talented; not because they wield terrifying text editors and pixel manipulators with the deftness of a Mayo Clinic surgeon (although they most certainly do). I know this because they are good at critique.
They are able to look at something — a design, concept, prototype — with a critical eye.</description></item><item><title>InVision This</title><link>http://drewux.com/posts/2016-06-05-invision-this/</link><pubDate>Sun, 05 Jun 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://drewux.com/posts/2016-06-05-invision-this/</guid><description>InVision This Much more than fancy screenshots 2 ½ minute read As you’ve probably gathered if you’ve been following along, I spend a lot of time talking about tools. Too much, probably. Tools, after all, don’t make the craftsman. But, here I go again: After a couple of weeks using InVision.app for a project of some complexity, I have to say. Wow.
I’ve been aware of InVision for awhile, but always thought of it as a fancy presentation tool (which it is) and nothing more (which it isn’t).</description></item><item><title>Fidelity</title><link>http://drewux.com/posts/2016-05-29-fidelity/</link><pubDate>Sun, 29 May 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://drewux.com/posts/2016-05-29-fidelity/</guid><description>Fidelity When making wireframes, aim somewhere between hi-fi and lo-fi 4 minute read We spent a lot of time this week discussing fidelity as it pertains to UX deliverables: Wireframes in this case. The traditional wisdom has always been that wireframes are quick and dirty interface representations, stripped of any visual design or branding elements. Their purpose is to communicate the general layout and content of a page without getting too deep into the visual design.</description></item><item><title>Know Your Tools</title><link>http://drewux.com/posts/2016-05-22-know-your-tools/</link><pubDate>Sun, 22 May 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://drewux.com/posts/2016-05-22-know-your-tools/</guid><description>Know your tools Investing time creating a basic toolkit early can really pay off 2 minute read Which design tools you use are far less important than how well you can use them. This became especially apparent after weeks of using a template I created for the last class. It was easy. The bugs were ironed out. It looked okay. It didn&amp;rsquo;t win me any points for creative vision but it was fast and got the job done.</description></item><item><title>UX Yin and Yang: Balancing Organizational Goals and the Needs of Your Users</title><link>http://drewux.com/posts/2015-12-08-ux-yin-yang/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Dec 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://drewux.com/posts/2015-12-08-ux-yin-yang/</guid><description>UX Yin and Yang Balancing Organizational Goals and the Needs of Your Users 4½ minute read The disciplines of user-centered design have taught us to go to great lengths to ensure that we meet the needs of users when it comes to our products, but we shouldn’t be doing so at the expense of the organization’s goals.
Call it a lesson learned. Awhile back my buddy (whom I&amp;rsquo;ll call &amp;ldquo;Ted,&amp;rdquo; in an attempt to spare his identity) completed a project that he’d spent significant time designing and building.</description></item><item><title>Quotable: The Best Thing for Being Sad</title><link>http://drewux.com/posts/2015-12-03-thought-of-today/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Dec 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://drewux.com/posts/2015-12-03-thought-of-today/</guid><description>The Best Thing for Being Sad 1 minute read “The best thing for being sad,” replied Merlin, beginning to puff and blow, “is to learn something. That’s the only thing that never fails. You may grow old and trembling in your anatomies, you may lie awake at night listening to the disorder of your veins, you may miss your only love, you may see the world about you devastated by evil lunatics, or know your honour trampled in the sewers of baser minds.</description></item><item><title>Getting the Most Out of your CMS</title><link>http://drewux.com/posts/2015-12-01-omg-cms/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Dec 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://drewux.com/posts/2015-12-01-omg-cms/</guid><description>Getting the Most Out of your CMS 4½ minute read “We become what we behold. We shape our tools, and thereafter our tools shape us.” ― Marshall McLuhan
When it comes to deciding on a content management system for a business or organization, how much should you expect your CMS to do? Is the solution you choose going to be a magic bullet that automatically enforces policy and standards? Should it encapsulate your entire workflow?</description></item><item><title>Five Content Strategy Challenges (and How to Overcome Them): Part 2, Management</title><link>http://drewux.com/posts/2015-11-19-content-challenges-part-2/</link><pubDate>Thu, 19 Nov 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://drewux.com/posts/2015-11-19-content-challenges-part-2/</guid><description>Five Content Strategy Challenges (and How to Overcome Them) Part 2 — Challenges for Management 3½ minute read Last week I discussed the five most common content strategy challenges for content creators and strategists. Organizational leadership faces a similar predicament. With so much emphasis put on productivity, efficiency and the bottom line, it’s hard to embrace a concept that doesn’t show a clear benefit for the organization, introduces too much risk or just doesn’t fit in with their vision of the company and its values.</description></item><item><title>Five Content Strategy Challenges (and How to Overcome Them): Part 1, The Content Creator</title><link>http://drewux.com/posts/2015-11-10-content-challenges-part-1/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Nov 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://drewux.com/posts/2015-11-10-content-challenges-part-1/</guid><description>Five Content Strategy Challenges (and How to Overcome Them) Part 1 — The Content Creator 3½ minute read Content strategy is an important component of the design process and vital to the overall user experience.

You’ve built a Web site and need local search capabilities. Is it even worth it to develop your own solution when Google offers the whole deal by copying-and-pasting a few lines of code? With Google being able to crawl and catalog the expanse of (almost) the entire Web and present search results quickly and clearly to users, it’s a legitimate question to ask: Do any sites really need their own search systems?</description></item><item><title>The UX Triple Constraint: Time, Complexity and the User Experience</title><link>http://drewux.com/posts/2014-06-25-the-ux-triple-constraint/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Jun 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://drewux.com/posts/2014-06-25-the-ux-triple-constraint/</guid><description>The UX Triple-Constraint Time, Complexity and the User Experience 4 minute read Someone much smarter than I has probably already made this observation, but it occurred to me in a recent discussion with a product stakeholder that there exists a kind of “usability triple constraint,” not too different from the one folks in the project management world have recognized for years.
The triple constraint is a project management model that says that all projects are a balance of time, resources, and quality.</description></item><item><title/><link>http://drewux.com/contact/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://drewux.com/contact/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Archive</title><link>http://drewux.com/archive/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://drewux.com/archive/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Design Meaningful Experiences | About Drew</title><link>http://drewux.com/about/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://drewux.com/about/</guid><description>Design Meaningful Experiences: About Drew Hi, I&amp;rsquo;m Drew Todd, a dedicated professional with over 20 years of experience in Internet, Web, and mobile application development.
