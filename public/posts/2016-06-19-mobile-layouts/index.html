<h2 id="creating-a-reusable-layout-system-for-mobile">Creating a reusable layout system for mobile</h2>
<h3 id="4-frac12-minute-read">4 ½ minute read</h3>
<p>So, while slugging it out in the trenches this week, I sort of fell into an existential crisis with regards to the stuff I was putting on the screen for a mobile prototype. Panels, images, buttons, text fields&hellip; the sizing and positioning of these things all suddenly seemed so arbitrary. How can you defend a design decision if you can&rsquo;t explain why the thing on the screen looks like it does?</p>
<p>I go through this a lot. The thought-process of <em>defending a design decision</em>. Design is relatively subjective on the surface of it; qualitative in nature. A lot of it falls to aesthetics and personal opinions. So how do you <em>know</em> that a design decision is any good? Or objectively better than another decision?</p>
<p>This is the stuff that bounces around my noggin at 3 AM, when <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MP_yoqpIHNw" title="Have some culture, while you're here...">the sleeps</a> takes their leave of me.</p>
<p>In this case, the question at hand was: How do you go about making an orderly screen layout (specifically, for a mobile phone in portrait display)? With this dilemma firmly in mind, I took to the Slack to ask my fellow designers if they knew of any best practices, agreed upon norms, or handy rules of thumb I might employ:</p>
<p><a href="/img/slack-scale-elments.png" target="_blank" alt="View this image, full-size, in a new tab"><img src="/assets/img/slack-scale-elments.png" class="floatcenter" alt="Crazy question for you legit designers out there. When you design elements for screens (say, a mobile screen - iPhone), do you take into account scaling and proportion? Like… do you calculate optimal sizes for items based on screen real estate? Do you work on a grid?"/></a></p>
<p>I got a lot of good feedback. Everything from &ldquo;don&rsquo;t worry about it too much,&rdquo; to <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2007/04/designing-with-grid-based-approach/">grids</a>, to references to some really good online <a href="https://material.google.com/components/cards.html#cards-content" title="Google's Material Design">style guides</a>. Most folks had a system down for websites, but hadn&rsquo;t really messed with grids on mobile. It got me thinking some more, so I fired up Sketch and started playing around.</p>
<h2 id="169">16:9</h2>
<p>The first thing I observed was that iPhone and Android phones all have screens that are sized to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/16:9" title="16:9 - Wikipedia">16:9 aspect ratio</a> (actually a 9:16 ratio in portrait mode &ndash; for every 9 horizontal pixels, there are 16 vertical pixels), which is a ratio of 1.7778:1. This is <em>de rigeuer</em> in the AV industry for high-definition displays. This was handy. So I wondered if I created a 16:9 box and put it on a 9:16 screen, what I&rsquo;d get. I created a new artboard, sized for an iPhone 6 (375 x 667 pixels) and dropped a 375 x 210 pixel box on it (yep, 375 x 210 is a 16:9 aspect ratio).</p>
<p>It looked to me like that box took up about 1/3 of the screen. This was also handy. <a href="http://www.companyfolders.com/blog/rule-of-thirds-graphic-design">The rule of thirds</a> is a common visual maxim applied in design. This was doable.</p>
<p>Going further I dropped three 16:9 boxes on the screen and found that I had a little space left over. 37 pixels, to be exact. I was sad at first that there wasn&rsquo;t some divine equilibrium that I was about to discover (and at this stage, I should point out that I&rsquo;ve never been a math genius); some quasi-<a href="http://www.hongkiat.com/blog/golden-ratio-in-moden-designs/">golden ratio</a> perfection that would add up to a magical &ldquo;Om&rdquo; in the aggregate.</p>
<p>Those leftover 37 pixels bugged me at first. But then I realized that perfection wasn&rsquo;t what I was after; <em>practicality</em> was. And those 37 pixels. If I moved them to the top of the screen, they kind of looked like&hellip; a title bar.</p>
<p>I could work with this.</p>
<p><a href="/img/iphone-layout-screens-1.png" target="_blank" alt="View this image, full-size, in a new tab" class="noline"><img src="/assets/img/iphone-layout-screens-1.png" class="floatcenter"/>
<em>This kind of gives you a visual idea of what I was playing around with; trying to find some logic for creating sensible layouts.</em></a></p>
<h2 id="reusable-blocks">Reusable blocks</h2>
<p>So my next trick was to figure out how to create standard sizes (or blocks) for elements on the screen.</p>
<p>The 16:9 panel is 210 pixels tall. Sticking with the rule of thirds, I divided it into three 70 pixel tall panels. Those looked pretty good for standard elements like text boxes and form elements. Dividing them in half, I got 35 pixel tall rows. That looked like a good amount of padding to put between items. Four-row panels, five-row panels&hellip; it was as easy as the <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/css/#grid" title="Bootstrap">vertical</a> <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/sites/docs/v/5.5.3/components/grid.html" title="Foundation">grids</a> I&rsquo;d used for website layouts.</p>
<p>Just going by what my eye told me, these panel divisions were going to work.</p>
<p><a href="/img/iphone-layout-screens-2.png" target="_blank" alt="View this image, full-size, in a new tab" class="noline"><img src="/assets/img/iphone-layout-screens-2.png" class="floatcenter"/>
<em>Using the initial 16:9 panel, I divided into equal segments to create additional sized panels, ultimately ending up with a 35 pixel high row as the foundation</em></a></p>
<p>What I&rsquo;ve actually achieved, when all is said and done, is to create a horizontal grid for 9:16 screens that breaks down into 18 rows. All elements on the screen should match the height of 1 or more rows combined.</p>
<p>The layout below shows these blocks in action. Sample screens for a prototype I&rsquo;m working on (these aren&rsquo;t the real screens, I&rsquo;m just creating all of the elements in Sketch and making the symbol library for the prototype). As you can see, all of the block elements are sized using the 16:9 concept: Large heroesque panels are built on 6-row 16:9 panels, text input fields are 4 rows high, spacing between elements is 1 row (35 pixels). It&rsquo;s white-spacey, but I like that. It equates to <a href="http://www.educ.kent.edu/community/VLO/Design/principles/harmony/index.html">harmonious design</a>: All of the structural elements on the screen relate to and complement each other.</p>
<p><a href="/img/lmb-concepts.png" target="_blank" alt="View this image, full-size, in a new tab" class="noline"><img src="/assets/img/lmb-concepts.png" class="floatcenter"/>
<em>These screens show how the block elements might be used in a real-world scenario</em></a></p>
<h2 id="more-work-to-do">More work to do</h2>
<p>This is not a magic bullet, and there is still a lot of work to be done (I haven&rsquo;t even addressed vertical spacing, which I pretty much eyeballed), but it&rsquo;s a start. And it gives me something to work with when creating wireframes or prototypes. It also gives me some ammo when discussing <em>why</em> certain things look the way they do on the screen. Why I chose to put them where I did. It&rsquo;s a nice, simple framework that maybe I&rsquo;ll continue to play with and develop.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve got feedback, I&rsquo;d love to hear it.</p>
