With them, you can capture the user&rsquo;s actions and facial expressions and gain all kinds of insight into their behaviors, thoughts and expectations when using a product. But these tools can be equally useful in monitoring your own performance as a test moderator.</p><h2 id=the-camera-never-lies>The Camera Never Lies</h2><p>One of the pitfalls of running moderated usability tests is that you have to put another human being in the room with the test participant. And humans are, you know — flawed.</p><p>As such, that human moderator might bring their own biases into a test and provide subtle cues to the participant that they wouldn&rsquo;t receive in unmoderated testing. The human moderator might go on a talking jag, not realizing that they are quelling any impetus to express thoughts or insights by the participant. That human moderator may inadvertently spill the beans about a task&rsquo;s solution through their line of questioning or conversation with the participant.</p><p>That human moderator is going to be <strong>you</strong> at some point.</p><p>How do you <a href=http://www.userfocus.co.uk/articles/4-test-moderation-mistakes.html>avoid these pitfalls</a>? While there&rsquo;s no guarantee that you can avoid them altogether, you can certainly mitigate the problems by putting the best possible moderator in the room with the participant. You know: You.</p><p>Just as recorded sessions provide a wealth of information about the participant in a study, they also reveal a lot about you as a moderator. You should occasionally review your studies from a self-critique perspective to make sure that you&rsquo;re not violating any of the <a href=https://www.usertesting.com/blog/2014/09/22/12-expert-tips-for-moderating-like-a-pro/>rules or best practices of test moderation</a>.</p><h2 id=who-is-that-guy>Who <em>is</em> that guy?</h2><p>Having recently run a usability test to evaluate the utility of a popular pizza website, I decided to review my own performance as a moderator. I watched the playback of the 20 minute test (which I thought went very well at the time) and came away with a different view of the session. I also found some specific areas where I could focus and improve.</p><h3 id=to-be-or-not-to-be>To Be? Or Not To Be?</h3><p>As the test started, I read from a script that went some thing along the lines of:</p><p><em>&ldquo;Hi, Test Candidate. My name is Andrew, and I’m going to be walking you through this session today.&rdquo;</em></p><p>But sounded like:</p><p><em>&ldquo;HI TEST CANDIDATE. MY NAME IS ANDREW AND I AM TOTALLY <strong>NOT</strong> READING THIS SCRIPT FROM A SHEET OF PAPER. THIS IS MY <strong>NORMAL</strong> MANNER OF SPEAKING.&rdquo;</em></p><p>In other words: Stiff. And as I watched the participant&rsquo;s reaction to this Shakespearean monologue, I realized they noticed it, too.</p><p>One of your objectives as a moderator is to make the participant feel comfortable. One way you can do that is to act naturally and relaxed. Reading your test script word-for-word is probably not going to serve you as well as paraphrasing and speaking casually with the candidate.</p><p>So how could I improve on this? Better preparation and lots of practice will help alleviate the problem for future sessions.</p><h3 id=in-other-words>In Other Words…</h3><p>Another thing I caught myself doing during the session was paraphrasing what the candidate said in my own words; repeating it back to them.</p><p><em>Candidate: &ldquo;Wow. I didn&rsquo;t think that would happen.&rdquo;</em></p><p><em>Me: &ldquo;So, in other words, you expected to be taken to the menu page when you clicked on the link?&rdquo;</em></p><p><strong>Wrong.</strong> This is textbook leading the participant. While my intention was just to make sure I understood the user&rsquo;s context and expectation, I was planting a subtle suggestion into that seemingly innocent question.</p><p>Better to ask an open-ended question that gets the user talking about what&rsquo;s on <strong>their</strong> mind; not mine:</p><p><em>Me: &ldquo;What did you think would happen when you clicked that link?&rdquo;</em></p><p>If you need clarification &ldquo;in other words,&rdquo; make sure it&rsquo;s the test participant&rsquo;s words you receive.</p><h3 id=its-okay-to-bail-out>It&rsquo;s okay to bail out</h3><p>The test in question called for the candidate to complete three tasks. While the first and third went smoothly; the second task had them stumped. Unfortunately, we spent a lot of time &ldquo;in the weeds&rdquo; looking for something that just wasn&rsquo;t on the path that the user had chosen. I should have bailed when this became apparent.</p><p>Users are going to fail tasks. It&rsquo;s part of the process. But it&rsquo;s also important to keep in mind that failure — even when you&rsquo;ve explained that mistakes are <strong>your</strong> fault and never theirs — is disheartening. Spending a lot of time watching the user bang their head against a task you know they aren&rsquo;t going to successfully complete is not productive.</p><p>Once it becomes obvious that the participant is not going to successfully complete a task, you need to politely move on.</p><h2 id=test-observe-tweak-repeat>Test, Observe, Tweak, Repeat</h2><p>Developing your UX skills is not that much different than developing the digital products you work on. In this Agile-loving world we&rsquo;re living in, it pays to spend some time treating your own process the way you treat your products. Seek to iteratively improve your skills as a moderator by routinely reviewing your performance, looking for areas in which you can improve, making the necessary adjustments, and repeating the process.</p><p>Until next time…</p><p><em>*<a href=http://ohleona.blogspot.com/2013/05/the-sun-makes-me-crazy.html title="Oh!
