In the UX world, the term is used to describe that rare person who can do it all — design, research, write, and code — and do it at a very high level.

Magnitude combines the frequency that an issue was observed with the relative impact that it had on the participant&rsquo;s task completion.
After spending some time revisiting best practices in the realm of usability testing and reviewing the advice of some its more esteemed practitioners, I realized that there is a lot of talk about how to go about setting up such a test, and finding usability problems...</p>

One of the hallmarks of usability testing protocols is [the “Think Aloud” method][1]: Asking participants to verbalize their thoughts as they work through the tasks and activities of the test. This method allows the test team to get inside the head of the participant a bit and often illuminates behaviors or attitudes that wouldn’t be apparent by observation alone...</p>

We&rsquo;ve been talking about them this week and I thought I&rsquo;d share a little bit about our approach.
