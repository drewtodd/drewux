                <p>Embracing White Space Why Less Is More in UX Design 3 minute read You&rsquo;ve been there: you&rsquo;re presenting a sleek, functional user interface to stakeholders, only to have them request that you cram more information into the available space. Sound familiar? As UX designers, we often face the challenge of convincing stakeholders that white space is not wasted space, but rather a crucial element for creating an efficient, user-friendly experience...</p>

In the UX world, the term is used to describe that rare person who can do it all — design, research, write, and code — and do it at a very high level. It&rsquo;s become so common that companies looking for talent are putting out job ads for so-called &ldquo;unicorns...</p>

I’ve spent the last seven weeks diving into Interaction Design; looking into the design process for digital products from the user interface perspective...</p>

What your workspace looks like when you go home for the day is your business. It’s your space and you need to be comfortable and able to get stuff done. Maybe it’s a minimalist nirvana; clean and cool and white. Maybe it’s a nest of papers, books, half-empty soda cans… whatever works for you...</p>

                <p>Measure Twice, Cut Once Creating a reusable layout system for mobile 4 ½ minute read So, while slugging it out in the trenches this week, I sort of fell into an existential crisis with regards to the stuff I was putting on the screen for a mobile prototype. Panels, images, buttons, text fields&hellip; the sizing and positioning of these things all suddenly seemed so arbitrary. How can you defend a design decision if you can&rsquo;t explain why the thing on the screen looks like it does?..</p>

I know this not because my team is talented; not because they wield terrifying text editors and pixel manipulators with the deftness of a Mayo Clinic surgeon (although they most certainly do). I know this because they are good at critique.
They are able to look at something — a design, concept, prototype — with a critical eye...</p>

Too much, probably. Tools, after all, don’t make the craftsman. But, here I go again: After a couple of weeks using InVision.app for a project of some complexity, I have to say. Wow.
I’ve been aware of InVision for awhile, but always thought of it as a fancy presentation tool (which it is) and nothing more (which it isn’t)...</p>

The traditional wisdom has always been that wireframes are quick and dirty interface representations, stripped of any visual design or branding elements. Their purpose is to communicate the general layout and content of a page without getting too deep into the visual design...</p>

                <p>Know your tools Investing time creating a basic toolkit early can really pay off 2 minute read Which design tools you use are far less important than how well you can use them. This became especially apparent after weeks of using a template I created for the last class. It was easy. The bugs were ironed out. It looked okay. It didn&rsquo;t win me any points for creative vision but it was fast and got the job done...</p>
