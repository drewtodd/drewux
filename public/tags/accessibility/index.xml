&lt;p>Keyboard navigation is essential for many users, including those with motor disabilities, temporary injuries, or a preference for keyboard use. It involves more than tabbing through links; it&amp;rsquo;s about ensuring all interactive elements are accessible without a mouse.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Welcome back to our deep dive into web accessibility. After exploring color and contrast, we now focus on a vital yet often overlooked aspect: keyboard navigation. While primarily aimed at users with motor disabilities; it&amp;rsquo;s for anyone who relies on a keyboard to navigate the web.

&lt;p>Following up on my &lt;a href="http://drewux.com/posts/color-and-contrast/">previous article&lt;/a> about color and contrast ratio, it occurred to me that my own site could use a little attention in this area. It got me thinking: What would happen if I asked ChatGPT to analyze my stylesheet and make some recommendations for improvement? I wanted my contrast ratios to comply with &lt;a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/">WCAG 2.0 standards&lt;/a>. This journey was surprisingly fruitful, yielding tangible improvements as measured by &lt;a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/overview/">Google&amp;rsquo;s Lighthouse&lt;/a> tool.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Color and Contrast: Crafting Visually Accessible Websites</title><link>http://drewux.com/posts/color-and-contrast/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jun 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://drewux.com/posts/color-and-contrast/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="color-and-contrast">Color and Contrast&lt;/h1>
