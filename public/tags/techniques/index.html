Magnitude combines the frequency that an issue was observed with the relative impact that it had on the participant&rsquo;s task completion.
After spending some time revisiting best practices in the realm of usability testing and reviewing the advice of some its more esteemed practitioners, I realized that there is a lot of talk about how to go about setting up such a test, and finding usability problems...</p>

The camera and microphone are powerful implements in a usability tester&rsquo;s toolkit. With them, you can capture the user&rsquo;s actions and facial expressions and gain all kinds of insight into their behaviors, thoughts and expectations when using a product...</p>

One of the hallmarks of usability testing protocols is [the “Think Aloud” method][1]: Asking participants to verbalize their thoughts as they work through the tasks and activities of the test. This method allows the test team to get inside the head of the participant a bit and often illuminates behaviors or attitudes that wouldn’t be apparent by observation alone...</p>

Panels, images, buttons, text fields&hellip; the sizing and positioning of these things all suddenly seemed so arbitrary.
