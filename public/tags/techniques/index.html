<p>The camera and microphone are powerful implements in a usability tester&rsquo;s toolkit. With them, you can capture the user&rsquo;s actions and facial expressions and gain all kinds of insight into their behaviors, thoughts and expectations when using a product.

<blockquote>
<p>In the absence of eye-tracking equipment, ask test participants to use their mouse cursor to indicate where they’re looking on the screen.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One of the hallmarks of usability testing protocols is [the “Think Aloud” method][1]: Asking participants to verbalize their thoughts as they work through the tasks and activities of the test. This method allows the test team to get inside the head of the participant a bit and often illuminates behaviors or attitudes that wouldn’t be apparent by observation alone. It’s a great tool that we employ in <em>all</em> of our testing.</p>..</p>

<p>So, while slugging it out in the trenches this week, I sort of fell into an existential crisis with regards to the stuff I was putting on the screen for a mobile prototype. Panels, images, buttons, text fields&hellip; the sizing and positioning of these things all suddenly seemed so arbitrary.

<p>We spent a lot of time this week discussing fidelity as it pertains to UX deliverables: Wireframes in this case. The traditional wisdom has always been that wireframes are quick and dirty interface representations, <a href="http://theuxreview.co.uk/wireframes-beginners-guide/">stripped of any visual design or branding elements</a>. Their purpose is to <a href="https://medium.com/@danritz/wireframes-a-good-communication-tool-a-poor-design-tool-1bc64b033962#.xbomavigp">communicate the general layout and content of a page</a> without getting too deep into the visual design.

<p>Last week I discussed the five most common content strategy challenges for content creators and strategists. Organizational leadership faces a similar predicament. With so much emphasis put on productivity, efficiency and the bottom line, it’s hard to embrace a concept that doesn’t show a clear benefit for the organization, introduces too much risk or just doesn’t fit in with their vision of the company and its values. If you’re a manager, or you’re trying to convince executives to embrace content strategy, these challenges are probably all-too-familiar.</p>..</p>
