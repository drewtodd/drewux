Agile development has long been known for its programmer-centric approach, which can sometimes leave UX feeling like a &amp;ldquo;side process.&amp;rdquo; However, I strongly believe that UX should be baked into the entire iterative process, much like QA validating dev work. UX validates design decisions and helps uncover user needs, driving product design. In this article, we&amp;rsquo;ll explore how to reconcile UX and Agile development by integrating UX design into the Agile process for a holistic, user-centric product development approach.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;scrum-kanban-and-scrumban-integrating-ux-into-agile-methodologies&#34;&gt;Scrum, Kanban, and Scrumban: Integrating UX into Agile Methodologies&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;explore-the-pros-and-cons-of-scrum-kanban-and-hybrid-approaches-for-ux-practitioners-in-the-agile-world&#34;&gt;Explore the pros and cons of Scrum, Kanban, and hybrid approaches for UX practitioners in the Agile world&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A handful of years back, I found myself participating in a Scrum-focused Agile training with the aim of earning certification. Coming from a UX background, I couldn’t help but be plagued by a persistent concern: how on earth does UX fit into all of this? So, on the final day of training, I posed the question to our instructor. He mulled it over for a moment before suggesting that UX is something you tackle at the very beginning of the process, and then you dive into Scrum. This didn’t seem very iterative or agile at all!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
