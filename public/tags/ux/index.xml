&lt;p>Keyboard navigation is essential for many users, including those with motor disabilities, temporary injuries, or a preference for keyboard use. It involves more than tabbing through links; it&amp;rsquo;s about ensuring all interactive elements are accessible without a mouse.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Welcome back to our deep dive into web accessibility. After exploring color and contrast, we now focus on a vital yet often overlooked aspect: keyboard navigation. While primarily aimed at users with motor disabilities; it&amp;rsquo;s for anyone who relies on a keyboard to navigate the web. This could include people with temporary disabilities (being forced, for instance, to use their non-dominant hand due to an injury), or a power-user who prefers to do as much navigating via the keyboard as possible.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>I Asked ChatGPT to Fix My Website: How I Used AI to Enhance My Website's Accessibility</title><link>http://drewux.com/posts/i-asked-chatgpt-to-fix-my-website/</link><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jun 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://drewux.com/posts/i-asked-chatgpt-to-fix-my-website/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="i-asked-chatgpt-to-fix-my-website">I Asked ChatGPT to Fix My Website&lt;/h1>

I wanted my contrast ratios to comply with &lt;a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/">WCAG 2.0 standards&lt;/a>.

So, on the final day of training, I posed the question to our instructor. He mulled it over for a moment before suggesting that UX is something you tackle at the very beginning of the process, and then you dive into Scrum.

This method allows the test team to get inside the head of the participant a bit and often illuminates behaviors or attitudes that wouldn’t be apparent by observation alone. It’s a great tool that we employ in &lt;em>all&lt;/em> of our testing.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Formative vs. Summative Usability Studies</title><link>http://drewux.com/posts/2016-09-10-formative-summative-usability/</link><pubDate>Sat, 10 Sep 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://drewux.com/posts/2016-09-10-formative-summative-usability/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="staying-ahead-of-the-wave">Staying Ahead of the Wave&lt;/h1>

&lt;p>When looking at usability studies, you can generally lump them into two groups: &lt;a href="http://www.usabilitybok.org/formative-evaluation">Formative studies&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="http://www.usabilitybok.org/summative-evaluation">summative studies&lt;/a>. We&amp;rsquo;ve been talking about them this week and I thought I&amp;rsquo;d share a little bit about our approach.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="formative-studies">Formative Studies&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Formative studies, as the name implies, tend to happen at the beginning of the design process and are used to help guide the product in the right direction. They are a key part of the iterative design process, where you&amp;rsquo;re generating design ideas, testing them, and adjusting the design on the fly.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Remote UX Observation</title><link>http://drewux.com/posts/2016-09-01-getting-out-of-the-room/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Sep 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://drewux.com/posts/2016-09-01-getting-out-of-the-room/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="remote-ux-observation">Remote UX Observation&lt;/h1>

&lt;p>One of the major tenets we adhere to as a team is &lt;strong>transparency&lt;/strong>: All members of the team should have access to information about the project we’re working on. Designers, Developers, QA Analysts, Stakeholders: They all should have a complete picture of what’s going on and access to any details of the project that might help them gain product perspective and user insights.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>IxD Retrospective</title><link>http://drewux.com/posts/2016-07-01-ixd-retrospective/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Jul 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://drewux.com/posts/2016-07-01-ixd-retrospective/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="retrospective">Retrospective&lt;/h1>

&lt;p>So another course in the &lt;a href="https://onlinedegrees.kent.edu/programs-courses/graduate/user-experience-design/">Kent State University User Experience Design Masters program&lt;/a> comes to an end and, as one of its requirements has been these weekly updates, I thought it would be a good idea to use the final one to look back on the class.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I’ve spent the last seven weeks diving into &lt;strong>Interaction Design&lt;/strong>; looking into the design process for digital products from the user interface perspective. This was the first time that this particular course was offered (which I find surprising), with the Department Chair reaching out to students only a month or so beforehand to see if there was any interest in taking such a class. As you might expect, it was a little thrown-together and rough around the edges.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Measure Twice, Cut Once</title><link>http://drewux.com/posts/2016-06-19-mobile-layouts/</link><pubDate>Sun, 19 Jun 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://drewux.com/posts/2016-06-19-mobile-layouts/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="measure-twice-cut-once">Measure Twice, Cut Once&lt;/h1>

&lt;p>So, while slugging it out in the trenches this week, I sort of fell into an existential crisis with regards to the stuff I was putting on the screen for a mobile prototype. Panels, images, buttons, text fields&amp;hellip; the sizing and positioning of these things all suddenly seemed so arbitrary. How can you defend a design decision if you can&amp;rsquo;t explain why the thing on the screen looks like it does?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Critique</title><link>http://drewux.com/posts/2016-06-12-critique/</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 Jun 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://drewux.com/posts/2016-06-12-critique/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="critique">Critique&lt;/h1>

&lt;p>I know this not because my team is talented; not because they wield terrifying text editors and pixel manipulators with the deftness of a Mayo Clinic surgeon (although they most certainly do). I know this because they are good at critique.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>They are able to look at something — a design, concept, prototype — with a critical eye.

&lt;p>As you’ve probably gathered if you’ve been following along, I spend a lot of time &lt;a href="http://drewux.com/omg-cms">talking&lt;/a> &lt;a href="know-your-tools">about&lt;/a> &lt;a href="fidelity">tools&lt;/a>. Too much, probably. Tools, after all, don’t make the craftsman. But, here I go again: After a couple of weeks using &lt;a href="http://www.invisionapp.com/" title="InVision.app">InVision.app&lt;/a> for a project of some complexity, I have to say. Wow.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I’ve been aware of InVision for awhile, but always thought of it as a fancy presentation tool (which it is) and nothing more (which it isn’t). You do all the real design work in another tool like Sketch, Illustrator, or Photoshop, right?

&lt;p>We spent a lot of time this week discussing fidelity as it pertains to UX deliverables: Wireframes in this case. The traditional wisdom has always been that wireframes are quick and dirty interface representations, &lt;a href="http://theuxreview.co.uk/wireframes-beginners-guide/">stripped of any visual design or branding elements&lt;/a>. Their purpose is to &lt;a href="https://medium.com/@danritz/wireframes-a-good-communication-tool-a-poor-design-tool-1bc64b033962#.xbomavigp">communicate the general layout and content of a page&lt;/a> without getting too deep into the visual design.

&lt;p>Which design tools you use are far less important than how well you can use them. This became especially apparent after weeks of using a template I created for the last class. It was easy. The bugs were ironed out. It looked okay. It didn&amp;rsquo;t win me any points for creative vision but it was fast and got the job done. Most important, it removed a lot of guesswork from my writing assignments.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>UX Yin and Yang: Balancing Organizational Goals and the Needs of Your Users</title><link>http://drewux.com/posts/2015-12-08-ux-yin-yang/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Dec 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://drewux.com/posts/2015-12-08-ux-yin-yang/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="ux-yin-and-yang">UX Yin and Yang&lt;/h1>

&lt;p>The disciplines of user-centered design have taught us to go to great lengths to ensure that we meet the needs of users when it comes to our products, but we shouldn’t be doing so at the expense of the organization’s goals.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Call it a lesson learned. Awhile back my buddy (whom I&amp;rsquo;ll call &amp;ldquo;Ted,&amp;rdquo; in an attempt to spare his identity) completed a project that he’d spent significant time designing and building. His team had gone to great lengths to make this Web-based application a user-centered winner: They’d researched, created detailed user personas, interviewed and observed real users in their native environments, prototyped their brains out, iterated. They had it all figured out.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Five Content Strategy Challenges (and How to Overcome Them): Part 2, Management</title><link>http://drewux.com/posts/2015-11-19-content-challenges-part-2/</link><pubDate>Thu, 19 Nov 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://drewux.com/posts/2015-11-19-content-challenges-part-2/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="five-content-strategy-challenges-and-how-to-overcome-them">Five Content Strategy Challenges (and How to Overcome Them)&lt;/h1>

&lt;p>Last week I discussed the five most common content strategy challenges for content creators and strategists. Organizational leadership faces a similar predicament. With so much emphasis put on productivity, efficiency and the bottom line, it’s hard to embrace a concept that doesn’t show a clear benefit for the organization, introduces too much risk or just doesn’t fit in with their vision of the company and its values. If you’re a manager, or you’re trying to convince executives to embrace content strategy, these challenges are probably all-too-familiar.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Five Content Strategy Challenges (and How to Overcome Them): Part 1, The Content Creator</title><link>http://drewux.com/posts/2015-11-10-content-challenges-part-1/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Nov 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://drewux.com/posts/2015-11-10-content-challenges-part-1/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="five-content-strategy-challenges-and-how-to-overcome-them">Five Content Strategy Challenges (and How to Overcome Them)&lt;/h1>

&lt;p>Content strategy is an important component of the design process and vital to the overall user experience. It ensures that the organization’s content aligns with its goals and values.

&lt;p>Content creators and strategists have it rough.

&lt;p>Someone much smarter than I has probably already made this observation, but it occurred to me in a recent discussion with a product stakeholder that there exists a kind of “usability triple constraint,” not too different from the one folks in the project management world have recognized for years.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_management_triangle" title="The Project Management Triangle - Wikipedia">triple constraint&lt;/a> is a project management model that says that all projects are a balance of time, resources, and quality.
