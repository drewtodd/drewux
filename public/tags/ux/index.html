<p>Keyboard navigation is essential for many users, including those with motor disabilities, temporary injuries, or a preference for keyboard use. It involves more than tabbing through links; it&rsquo;s about ensuring all interactive elements are accessible without a mouse.</p></blockquote>
<p>Welcome back to our deep dive into web accessibility. After exploring color and contrast, we now focus on a vital yet often overlooked aspect: keyboard navigation. While primarily aimed at users with motor disabilities; it&rsquo;s for anyone who relies on a keyboard to navigate the web. This could include people with temporary disabilities (being forced, for instance, to use their non-dominant hand due to an injury), or a power-user who prefers to do as much navigating via the keyboard as possible.</p>..</p>

<p>Following up on my <a href="/posts/color-and-contrast/">previous article</a> about color and contrast ratio, it occurred to me that my own site could use a little attention in this area. It got me thinking: What would happen if I asked ChatGPT to analyze my stylesheet and make some recommendations for improvement? I wanted my contrast ratios to comply with <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/">WCAG 2.0 standards</a>. This journey was surprisingly fruitful, yielding tangible improvements as measured by <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/overview/">Google&rsquo;s Lighthouse</a> tool.</p>..</p>

<p>Discover how to reconcile UX and Agile development by integrating UX design into the Agile process for a holistic, user-centric product development approach.</p></blockquote>
<p>Welcome to my second installment focused on UX and Agile. Agile development has long been known for its programmer-centric approach, which can sometimes leave UX feeling like a &ldquo;side process.&rdquo; However, I strongly believe that UX should be baked into the entire iterative process, much like QA validating dev work. UX validates design decisions and helps uncover user needs, driving product design. In this article, we&rsquo;ll explore how to reconcile UX and Agile development by integrating UX design into the Agile process for a holistic, user-centric product development approach.</p>..</p>

<p>A handful of years back, I found myself participating in a Scrum-focused Agile training with the aim of earning certification. Coming from a UX background, I couldn’t help but be plagued by a persistent concern: how on earth does UX fit into all of this? So, on the final day of training, I posed the question to our instructor. He mulled it over for a moment before suggesting that UX is something you tackle at the very beginning of the process, and then you dive into Scrum. This didn’t seem very iterative or agile at all!</p>..</p>

<p>One of the hallmarks of usability testing protocols is [the “Think Aloud” method][1]: Asking participants to verbalize their thoughts as they work through the tasks and activities of the test. This method allows the test team to get inside the head of the participant a bit and often illuminates behaviors or attitudes that wouldn’t be apparent by observation alone. It’s a great tool that we employ in <em>all</em> of our testing.</p>..</p>

<h2 id="formative-studies">Formative Studies</h2>
<p>Formative studies, as the name implies, tend to happen at the beginning of the design process and are used to help guide the product in the right direction. They are a key part of the iterative design process, where you&rsquo;re generating design ideas, testing them, and adjusting the design on the fly.</p>..</p>

<p>So another course in the <a href="https://onlinedegrees.kent.edu/programs-courses/graduate/user-experience-design/">Kent State University User Experience Design Masters program</a> comes to an end and, as one of its requirements has been these weekly updates, I thought it would be a good idea to use the final one to look back on the class.</p>
<p>I’ve spent the last seven weeks diving into <strong>Interaction Design</strong>; looking into the design process for digital products from the user interface perspective. This was the first time that this particular course was offered (which I find surprising), with the Department Chair reaching out to students only a month or so beforehand to see if there was any interest in taking such a class. As you might expect, it was a little thrown-together and rough around the edges.</p>..</p>

<p>As you’ve probably gathered if you’ve been following along, I spend a lot of time <a href="/omg-cms">talking</a> <a href="know-your-tools">about</a> <a href="fidelity">tools</a>. Too much, probably. Tools, after all, don’t make the craftsman. But, here I go again: After a couple of weeks using <a href="http://www.invisionapp.com/" title="InVision.app">InVision.app</a> for a project of some complexity, I have to say. Wow.</p>
<p>I’ve been aware of InVision for awhile, but always thought of it as a fancy presentation tool (which it is) and nothing more (which it isn’t). You do all the real design work in another tool like Sketch, Illustrator, or Photoshop, right? Well, yeah, but…</p>..</p>

<p>We spent a lot of time this week discussing fidelity as it pertains to UX deliverables: Wireframes in this case. The traditional wisdom has always been that wireframes are quick and dirty interface representations, <a href="http://theuxreview.co.uk/wireframes-beginners-guide/">stripped of any visual design or branding elements</a>. Their purpose is to <a href="https://medium.com/@danritz/wireframes-a-good-communication-tool-a-poor-design-tool-1bc64b033962#.xbomavigp">communicate the general layout and content of a page</a> without getting too deep into the visual design. The thinking goes, &ldquo;Any UX schmoe can throw down a wireframe and leave the work of making it look nice to the <em>real</em> designers.&rdquo;</p>..</p>

<p>Which design tools you use are far less important than how well you can use them. This became especially apparent after weeks of using a template I created for the last class. It was easy. The bugs were ironed out. It looked okay. It didn&rsquo;t win me any points for creative vision but it was fast and got the job done. Most important, it removed a lot of guesswork from my writing assignments.</p>..</p>

<p>The disciplines of user-centered design have taught us to go to great lengths to ensure that we meet the needs of users when it comes to our products, but we shouldn’t be doing so at the expense of the organization’s goals.</p></blockquote>
<p>Call it a lesson learned. Awhile back my buddy (whom I&rsquo;ll call &ldquo;Ted,&rdquo; in an attempt to spare his identity) completed a project that he’d spent significant time designing and building. His team had gone to great lengths to make this Web-based application a user-centered winner: They’d researched, created detailed user personas, interviewed and observed real users in their native environments, prototyped their brains out, iterated. They had it all figured out.</p>..</p>

<p>Last week I discussed the five most common content strategy challenges for content creators and strategists. Organizational leadership faces a similar predicament. With so much emphasis put on productivity, efficiency and the bottom line, it’s hard to embrace a concept that doesn’t show a clear benefit for the organization, introduces too much risk or just doesn’t fit in with their vision of the company and its values. If you’re a manager, or you’re trying to convince executives to embrace content strategy, these challenges are probably all-too-familiar.</p>..</p>

<p>Content strategy is an important component of the design process and vital to the overall user experience. It ensures that the organization’s content aligns with its goals and values. With that in mind, here are ten key challenges that content creators and management face with content strategy, and some proposed solutions.</p>

<p>Content creators and strategists have it rough. Slogging it out in the trenches, we often see first-hand some of the impediments that constantly threaten our productivity, the quality of our work, and <a href="http://www.cyclaudiia.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/week-10-1-content-strategy.gif">our sanity</a>; often without the political clout or influence to effect a change.

<p>Someone much smarter than I has probably already made this observation, but it occurred to me in a recent discussion with a product stakeholder that there exists a kind of “usability triple constraint,” not too different from the one folks in the project management world have recognized for years.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_management_triangle" title="The Project Management Triangle - Wikipedia">triple constraint</a> is a project management model that says that all projects are a balance of time, resources, and quality. Or, as the sign behind the counter at my auto mechanic puts it:</p>..</p>
