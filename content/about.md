<img src="/assets/img/andrew-todd.jpg" alt="Andrew Todd" title="Andrew Todd" class="floatright" />

Hey there. I'm Andrew Todd: 20-year veteran of Internet, Web, and mobile application development; a certified project manager with a design and engineering background; and the Director of Web Development at [a big AV manufacturer in Anaheim, CA][1], working with a killer team that builds [award][2]–[winning][3] [digital][4] [products][5].

I’m also passionate about how people interact with digital products and platforms; what works, what doesn’t, and why. This site is kind of a scrapbook of musings, ideas, examples, and ephemera that get me thinking about the best way to meet the needs of online users. Maybe it’ll get you thinking, too.

When I’m not nerding out about design, development, and UX, I’m probably picking a guitar, watching a baseball game, or walking the dog with my lovely wife.

Want to get in touch? You can catch me on [Twitter][6], over at [LinkedIn][7], or just send me a [good old email][8].
