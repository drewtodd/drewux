# Design Meaningful Experiences: About Drew

Hi, I'm Drew Todd, a dedicated professional with over 20 years of experience in Internet, Web, and mobile application development. As a certified project manager, I bring my design and engineering expertise to my role as the Director of Web Development at a renowned AV manufacturer in Anaheim, CA, where I lead a talented team in creating award-winning digital products.

My passion lies in understanding and enhancing user experiences. This blog focuses on my insights into UX research and design, AI, agile development, and personal productivity, and how these elements contribute to creating exceptional digital products. By delving into the intricacies of user interaction and product design, I aim to empower businesses to meet their objectives while offering users delightful experiences.

When I'm not exploring the world of UX, I enjoy playing guitar, attending baseball games, and spending quality time with my wife and our furry friend on leisurely walks.
