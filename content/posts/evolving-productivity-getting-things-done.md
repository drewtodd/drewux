# Evolving Productivity: Getting Things Done
## How David Allen's Productivity System Changed the Game for Me

> I dive deeper into personal productivity systems by exploring my transition from the Franklin Planner to David Allen's Getting Things Done method, and how a combination of the two has helped me achieve greater success.

Continuing our [discussion][1] of personal productivity systems, we've already explored the Franklin Planner system and its connection to Benjamin Franklin's methods. As we continue, let's take a look at another powerful productivity system: David Allen's Getting Things Done (GTD) method. In this follow-up article, I'll share my experiences transitioning from the Franklin Planner to GTD, and how customizing a combination of both systems has helped me achieve greater productivity.

As a refresher, the [Franklin Planner system][2] is an analog productivity tool that revolves around organizing tasks, setting goals, and prioritizing activities. It's heavily influenced by [Benjamin Franklin's 13 virtues][3] and his methods for personal development. While the Franklin Planner laid the foundation for my productivity journey, I eventually discovered GTD and found it to be a more flexible and adaptable system.

David Allen's GTD method, introduced in his book "[Getting Things Done: The Art of Stress-Free Productivity][4]," focuses on capturing, clarifying, organizing, reflecting, and engaging with tasks in a systematic manner. This five-step process allows you to manage your workload more effectively and maintain a clear mind.

My GTD journey began with an analog setup, using a wire in-basket, pen, and paper to capture and organize tasks, much like the Franklin Planner. However, as technology advanced and digital tools became more prevalent, I found myself transitioning to a digital GTD system using tools like Things.app, Bear.app, and Google Calendar. These digital solutions not only help me stay organized, but also adapt to the constantly changing demands of my work and personal life.

> Special shout-out to [Gina Trapani][5], founder of [Lifehacker][8] and [OG GTD adherent][6]. Gina created the first -- to my knowledge -- GTD app: [Todo.txt][7]. I originally learned about GTD from her writings and, after reading the book, found guidance in migrating from analog to digital in her work.

It's important to note that while both the Franklin Planner's value-based philosophy and the GTD system are effective on their own, I've found that a customized combination of the two works best for me. By cherry-picking elements from both systems and adapting them to fit my personal workflow, I've been able to create a unique productivity system that meets my needs and helps me achieve my goals.

Of course, your mileage may vary, and what works for me may not work for you. The key is to experiment with different systems, tools, and techniques to find the perfect combination that suits your personal and professional needs. I'm always curious to learn about new tips and tricks! Please share your own experiences and insights over on [Twitter][9]. How do you manage your own personal productivity systems?

The journey from the Franklin Planner to GTD and beyond has been an enlightening one. By embracing the benefits of both systems and adapting them to fit my unique workflow, I've been able to achieve greater productivity and personal growth. As you explore your own productivity journey, remember that there is no one-size-fits-all solution. It's all about finding the right combination of methods and tools that work best for you.

Next time, I'll cover my specific system and how I use digital tools to keep myself organized, on task, and inline with what's important.

See you then!
