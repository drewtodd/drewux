# Starting with Accessibility in Mind
## Building Inclusive Web Experiences
### 5 minute read

> This is the second in a series of articles looking into the requirements, tools, and techniques surrounding [accessible web design](/tags/accessibility).  

In the journey of creating accessible web design, it's crucial to start with a foundation that prioritizes accessibility from the outset. This second article in our series dives into how you can embed an accessibility-first mindset in your web projects from the beginning.
## Embracing an Accessibility-First Approach
### Understanding the Basics
Before we start designing or coding, it's essential to understand the various disabilities that can affect web usage:
* **Visual Impairments**: This includes a range of conditions, from partial vision loss and color blindness to total blindness. For example, a person with color blindness might not distinguish between red and green buttons, while someone with low vision may require text magnification.
* **Auditory Impairments**: Individuals with hearing loss require alternatives to audio content. For instance, providing captions for videos ensures that users with hearing difficulties can still access the information.
* **Motor Impairments**: This category includes conditions that affect movement, making tasks like clicking a mouse or tapping on a mobile screen challenging. For example, someone with Parkinson's disease may have difficulty with fine motor control, necessitating larger clickable areas.
* **Cognitive Impairments**: These can range from learning disabilities to conditions like Alzheimer's disease. It may affect memory, attention, problem-solving, and comprehension. For instance, a person with dyslexia might struggle with complex text layout and fonts.

Educating Your Team
Accessibility is a team effort. Ensure your designers, developers, and content creators understand these principles and consider them in their work.
## Setting Up for Success
As we delve into building websites with an accessibility-first approach, it's essential to arm ourselves with the right tools and resources. These tools not only facilitate the creation of accessible content but also streamline the process, making it easier to adhere to best practices from the start.

### Creating an Accessibility Checklist
A well-structured accessibility checklist is essential for ensuring your website meets various accessibility standards. Here’s an example checklist that covers key areas:
#### Visual Design
- [ ] **Color Contrast**: Ensure text and background colors have a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1.
- [ ] **Text Size**: Text should be resizable up to 200% without loss of content or functionality.
- [ ] **Consistent Navigation**: Maintain consistent navigation across all pages.
#### Auditory Content
- [ ] **Transcripts for Audio**: Provide transcripts for all audio content.
- [ ] **Captions for Videos**: Offer captions for all video content, including descriptions of key visual elements.
#### Interactive Elements
- [ ] **Keyboard Accessibility**: Ensure all interactive elements are operable with keyboard-only controls.
- [ ] **Visible Focus**: Include a visible focus indicator for interactive elements.
- [ ] **Labels for Forms**: Ensure all form inputs have associated text labels.
#### Screen Reader Compatibility
- [ ] **Alt Text for Images**: Provide alternative text for all images conveying information.
- [ ] **ARIA Roles**: Use ARIA roles where appropriate to enhance screen reader experience.
- [ ] **Semantic HTML**: Use proper HTML5 elements for enhanced screen reader interpretation.
#### Cognitive Accessibility
- [ ] **Readable Fonts**: Use fonts that are easy to read and avoid small font sizes.
- [ ] **Clear Language**: Use plain language and avoid jargon or complex language structures.
- [ ] **Predictable Layouts**: Maintain a predictable layout and avoid unexpected changes during navigation.
#### Testing and Validation
- [ ] **Automated Testing**: Regularly run automated accessibility tests using tools like WAVE or Google Lighthouse.
- [ ] **User Testing**: Conduct user testing with individuals who have disabilities to gather feedback.

## Building an Accessibility Team
### Roles and Responsibilities
#### Small Teams
In smaller teams, where resources might be limited, roles can be more fluid, with team members often wearing multiple hats.
* **Accessibility Coordinator**: A designated team member (often a lead designer or developer) who takes on the responsibility of ensuring accessibility considerations are integrated into all phases of the project. They stay updated on guidelines and lead the team in implementing best practices.
* **All Team Members**: Everyone on the team takes on some responsibility for accessibility. Designers focus on visual accessibility, developers ensure semantic HTML and keyboard navigation, and content creators prioritize clear language and alt text.
#### Medium Teams
Medium-sized teams might have more specialized roles while still maintaining collaborative cross-functional responsibilities.
* **Dedicated Accessibility Specialist**: An individual whose primary focus is on accessibility. They conduct regular audits, provide training and resources, and act as the point of contact for accessibility-related issues.
* **UX Designer**: Focuses on accessible design principles, ensuring that layouts, color schemes, and typography meet accessibility standards.
* **Developers**: Implement technical aspects of accessibility, such as ARIA roles, keyboard accessibility, and screen reader compatibility.
* **Content Strategist**: Ensures that all content is understandable, including the use of plain language and providing transcripts for audio and video content.
#### Large Teams
In larger organizations, there is often the capacity for a more comprehensive accessibility team with specialized roles.
* **Accessibility Team Lead**: Oversees the entire accessibility strategy and ensures compliance with legal standards. They coordinate with various departments to integrate accessibility into the company culture.
