## Provide Context to ChatGPT

When working with ChatGPT, it's crucial to provide context about your project or problem to get the most valuable results. Here are some tips to help you get started:

**Acting as:** You might notice that all of these prompts are formatted "Acting as a senior UX researcher, [ prompt ]." Providing the AI with a user context better allows it to format it's output in a way that is more meaningful and provides some contextual constraints. It's a good best-practice for most prompts you provide.

**Be Specific:** Clearly describe your project, target audience, and goals to help ChatGPT better understand the context and provide more relevant suggestions.

**Share Constraints:** If you have any constraints or limitations, such as budget or time, mention them upfront. This information can help ChatGPT tailor its recommendations to your unique circumstances.

**Break Down Complex Problems:** If you're dealing with a complex issue, try breaking it down into smaller parts and ask ChatGPT for assistance with each aspect. This approach can make it easier for ChatGPT to provide targeted and actionable suggestions.

## Manage ChatGPT's Memory

It's important to note that ChatGPT's memory is confined to a single conversation session. Consequently, we recommend keeping all of your prompts in one chat to ensure that ChatGPT maintains context and provides the most relevant responses. If you start a new conversation session, ChatGPT will lose its memory of previous interactions, which may affect the quality of its responses. By maintaining consistency within a single chat, you'll be able to harness ChatGPT's full potential and receive more valuable results that can help improve your UX workflow.

## Workflow Engage!
By leveraging ChatGPT's capabilities, UX practitioners can enhance their workflow and create better, more user-centric designs. From brainstorming user personas to identifying usability issues, ChatGPT can provide valuable insights and support throughout the design process. Remember to keep all prompts within a single chat session to ensure consistent context and maximum value from ChatGPT's responses. As AI technology continues to evolve, the collaboration between UX designers and tools like ChatGPT will undoubtedly lead to more innovative and inclusive digital experiences for users worldwide. Embrace the power of AI and transform your UX workflow today!
