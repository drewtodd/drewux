Hey there, fellow UX advocates! Working remotely can be challenging on its own, and even more difficult when you're on a budget. Many of the most exciting and essential tools for conducting UX research and design come with heft monthly subscription costs. But don't worry, I've got your back. I've put together a list of five free tools that can help you navigate the world of remote UX without breaking the bank. Let's dive in and explore these budget-friendly UX tools!

1. **Google Meet (Video Conferencing)**: While Zoom might be a popular choice, [Google Meet](https://meet.google.com) offers a free, reliable alternative for video conferencing.

2. **Otter.ai (Transcription)**: Manually transcribing research sessions can be time-consuming. [Otter.ai](https://otter.ai) is a free transcription tool that uses AI to transcribe your meetings and interviews in real-time. The free plan offers 600 minutes of transcription per month, which should cover a good chunk of your research sessions.

3. **Trello (Project Management)**: Keeping track of projects, tasks, and deadlines can be tricky when working remotely. [Trello](https://trello.com) is a free and user-friendly project management tool that can help you stay organized with its visual, card-based interface.

4. **InVision Freehand (Digital Whiteboard)**: [InVision Freehand](https://freehand.invision.com) is a free digital whiteboard that allows you and your team to collaborate on sketches, wireframes, and mockups in real-time. It's a great alternative to physical whiteboards for remote teams.
